# Terms
- Parallelism: Dividing a single task into parts and running each in parallel.

# Notes
Gitignore tells git what files and directories to exclude from version control, use it to keep the repo clean from unnecessary temp files.

# Dev Log
## 29/12/2024
May attempt to add concurrency in the future, sticking to single core processes for now.

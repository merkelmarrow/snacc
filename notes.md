# Terms
- Parallelism: Dividing a single task into parts and running each in parallel.

# Notes
Gitignore tells git what files and directories to exclude from version control, use it to keep the repo clean from unnecessary temp files.
## gRPC
gRPC stands for gRPC Remote Procedure Call.
Protocol buffers are an easy and efficient method to serialise strucutured data. Smaller and faster than JSON.

Protobuf files -> Protobuf generator -> Generated source code

In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a different machine as if it were a local object. Define a service, specify the methods that can be called remotely, their paramaters and return types.

The first step when using protocol buffers is defining a structure for the data you want to serialise.
